# bonnie

An experiment with mixing artificial intelligence, zero-shot named entity recognition, and a whole bunch of A.I gobbledygook that I really don't know much about. So-called "Bonnie" because Discord's A.I chatbot was named Clyde.

## Goals

Have a Discord chat-bot that minimally resembles Clyde.

## To-do list of basic functionality

- [ ] connect to user provided LLM API
- [ ] respond to user prompts through a direct mention
- [ ] respond to user prompts through context analysis(?) (keep conversing even after responding to initial prompt)
- [ ] dynamic prompt cooldowns (allow more prompts to be requested when there's not a lot of traffic)
- [ ] server resource locking on demand (only allowing prompts to be requested from one server)

## To-do list of potential functionality

Nothing in my head as of 17th of July.
